## Introduction to Tracing

Tracing involves recording the journey of a request as it flows through multiple services in a microservice architecture. It helps identify latency issues, root causes of slow requests, and points of failure.

## What is Jaeger?

- Jaeger is an open-source, end-to-end distributed tracing system developed by Uber Technologies. It requires developers to instrument code using OpenTelemetry.
- It is used for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based architectures. It helps developers understand how requests flow through a complex system, by tracing the path a request takes and measuring how long each step in that path takes.
- Lightweight and easy to set up.
- Vendor-neutral (supports OpenTelemetry).

## Why Use Jaeger?

In modern applications, especially microservices architectures, a single user request can touch multiple services. When something goes wrong, it’s challenging to pinpoint the source of the problem. Jaeger helps in:
- Distributed context propagation.
- Latency analysis across microservices.
- Root cause identification of slow requests.
- Supports service-to-service tracing and function-level tracing.

## Core Concepts of Jaeger

- **Trace**: Represents the full journey of a request across services, providing a high-level overview of how requests flow through your architecture. Think of it as a detailed map that shows every stop a request makes in your system.
- **Span**: Each trace is made up of multiple spans. A span is a single operation within a trace, such as an API call or a database query. It has a start time and a duration.
- **Tags**: Tags are key-value pairs that provide additional context about a span. For example, a tag might indicate the HTTP method used (GET, POST) or the status code returned.
- **Logs**: Logs in a span provide details about what’s happening during that operation. They can capture events like errors or important checkpoints.
- **Context Propagation**: Ensures that trace data flows through the entire service chain by passing tracing information along with each service call.

## Jaeger Architecture

Jaeger operates with a modular architecture composed of four main components:
1. **Jaeger Agent:**
- Runs as a daemon process on the nodes.
- Collects tracing data from applications.
- Acts as a "buffer" before sending traces to the Jaeger Collector.
2. **Jaeger Collector:**
- Receives traces from the Jaeger Agent.
- Processes and validates trace data.
- Stores traces in a database (e.g., Elasticsearch, Cassandra).
3. **Storage:**
- Persistent storage for traces.
- Common options: Elasticsearch, Cassandra, or other compatible databases.
4. **Jaeger Query Service (UI):**
- Provides a web interface for querying and visualizing traces.
- Developers and DevOps engineers can analyze trace flows and latencies.

**Workflow:**
- Applications send trace data to Jaeger Agent.
- The Agent forwards data to Jaeger Collector.
- The Collector processes and stores the traces in Storage.
- Users access traces via the Jaeger UI.

## Instrumenting Your Code

To start tracing, you need to instrument your services. This means adding tracing capabilities to your code. Most popular programming languages and frameworks have libraries (e.g; OpenTelemetry) or middleware that make this easy

## Example of Tracing in Microservices

Suppose Service A calls Service B in a microservice architecture.

**Tracing Output in Jaeger:**
- The request trace will show spans:
    - Span 1: Service A → Middleware → Call Service B.
    - Span 2: Service B → Middleware → API Endpoint.
- Each span displays:
    - Operation Name
    - Start Time and Duration
    - Dependencies

This helps pinpoint delays between services and optimize the request flow.
